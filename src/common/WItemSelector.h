/**
 * This class represents a subset of a WItemSelection. It is a class for managing selections. The class is kept very restrictive. The selection
 * can't be edited after the instantiation of the class to keep the interface clean, easily usable and consistent among multiple threads. So
 * please DO NOT extend it to provide methods for changing it!
 *
 * This class can be seen as some kind of special "iterator" providing access to the underlying set without allowing it to be modified. The class
 * provides methods to access the whole set and the subset represented by itself. The restrictive interface ensures thread-safety and enforces
 * that each new selection is done by a new instance of this class, which is needed by the WPropertyVariable to work properly.
 *
 * \note the protected constructor avoids instance creation of classes not the WItemSelection. This is restrictive but needed. Nobody can create
 * instances of it, changing the underlying WItemSelection and using it as selector for another ItemSelection instance.
