// ############################# class WTensorSym<> #############################################

/**
 * Implements a symmetric tensor that has the same number of components in every
 * direction. A symmetric tensor has the same value for every permutation of the indices.
 *
 * For example, t(i,j) = t(j,i) for a tensor of order 2, and t(i,j,k) = t(j,i,k) = t(i,k,j)
 * = t(j,k,i) = t(k,i,j) = t(k,j,i) for a tensor of order 3.
 *
 * \tparam order The order of the tensor.
 * \tparam dim The dimension of the tensor, i.e. the number of components
 * in each direction.
 * \tparam Data_T The datatype of the components, double by default.
 *
 * \note The dimension may never be 0.
 * \note The type Data_T may not throw exceptions on construction, destruction or
 * during any assignment operator.
 *
 * Access to specific elements of the tensor can be achieved in 2 ways:
 *
 * - operator (), whose number of parameters matches the template parameter order.
 * - operator [], whose parameter is either an array or a std::vector of appropriate size.
 *
 * \note The datatype of the array or std::vector can be any type castable to std::size_t.
 * \note There is no bounds checking for the array version of operator [].
 * \note Operator () is not supported for orders larger than 6.
 *
 * This class optimizes memory usage. For example, for a symmetric tensor of order 2 and
 * dimension 3, only 6 values (instead of 9) need to be stored. However, there is additional
 * memory overhead per class (i.e. per allocation of the template parameters), which is of
 * constant size and thus does not depend on the number of instances.
 *
 * Usage and operators are the same as with WTensor. Note that changes to an
 * element t(i,j,k,...) also change every element whose indices are a permutation of i,j,k... .
 * \see WTensor
