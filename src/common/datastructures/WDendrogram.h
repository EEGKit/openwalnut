/**
 * Hirachical binary tree datastructure with spatial layout information called dendrogram.
 *
 * The following description is taken from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram A dendrogram (from Greek
 * dendron "tree", -gramma "drawing") is a tree diagram frequently used to illustrate the arrangement of the
 * clusters produced by hierarchical clustering.
 *
 * This implementation is based on three arrays (\ref m_objectOrder, \ref m_branching, \ref m_levelHeight) and
 * requires implicitly object lables from <dfn>0..n-1</dfn>. The idea is very similar to the idea described in
 * the paper: <em>F.J. Rohlf, Algorithm 76: Hierarchical clustering using the minimum spanning tree. Comput.
 * J. 16 (1973), pp. 93â€“95.</em>
