 * class is kept very restrictive to keep the interface clean and sleek and to keep the item set consistent among several threads. So please do
 * not implement any function that might change the item list. The would cause odd behaviour of all the WItemSelector instances. Items can only
 * be added until the first Selector instance is created.
