This is your entry point into OpenWalnut module development!

1. General:
***********

This directory contains a bunch of modules that demonstrate how to develop with/for
OpenWalnut. Get started with WToolkit. This file contains definitions for all the modules
that are required by OpenWalnut during load of your module.  Each module listed there can
than be found in the corresponding C++ files. They are extensively documented and describe
each step in detail. 

You need help? Check out our extensive code documentation when something is unclear, check
out http://www.openwalnut.org for more documentation or simply contact our developer
mailing list openwalnut-dev@lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de.

Now, directly dive into the code. You will see, getting started with OpenWalnut module
development is easy!
