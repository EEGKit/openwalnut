/**
 * This function is called by OpenWalnut, when loading your module to allow registration of additional classes and implementations that are not
 * WModule classes. At this point, OW is completely initialized, thus allowing you to register nearly everything to the sub-systems supporting
 * this. A typical example is the postprocessing meachnism in OpenWalnut. It allows you to register your own postprocessors easily. As this
 * function is called on start-up, before loading project files, you can rely on additional functionality in your project files and modules.
 *
 * \note this function is optional. You can remove it if you do not need it.

 * \param localPath this is the path to the toolkit. Our build system ensures, that your resources and shaders get placed there.
