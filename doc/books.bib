    abstract     = {Visualization in Medicine is the first book on visualization and
                    its application to problems in medical diagnosis, education,
                    and treatment. The book describes the algorithms, the applications
                    and their validation (how reliable are the results?), and the
                    clinical evaluation of the applications (are the techniques useful?).
                    It discusses visualization techniques from research literature
                    as well as the compromises required to solve practical clinical
                    problems.  The book covers image acquisition, image analysis,
                    and interaction techniques designed to explore and analyze the
                    data. The final chapter shows how visualization is used for planning
                    liver surgery, one of the most demanding surgical disciplines.
                    The book is based on several years of the authors' teaching and
                    research experience. Both authors have initiated and lead a variety
                    of interdisciplinary projects involving computer scientists and
                    medical doctors, primarily radiologists and surgeons. (taken
