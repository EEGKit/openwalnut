<h1>Nemtics</h1> 
<p>Visualization is our business!  Visualization makes data perceptible and imaginable to the mind. 
It is the interface between the user and imaging systems, measurement hardware, processing software,
simulation systems, and so much more. Accordingly, visualization's importance can't be
ranked high enough!
<br/>
We provide software, frameworks, training and consulting on visualization. As a major developer
and maintainer of OpenWalnut, we  
provide professional user- and developer-support to it. This allows our customers and users of OpenWalnut
to rely on professional support and a vivid development of the project.
