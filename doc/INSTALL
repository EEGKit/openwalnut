Building utilizes cmake and make.

The project should be built in the "build" directory. Assuming 
the currect working directory to be project's main directory, 
the following steps should do the trick:

> cd build
> ccmake ../src
PRESS 'c' for configuration
PRESS 'c' again for further configuration
PRESS 'g' to generate the build system including the Makefiles.
> make

Now the "build" directory should contain an executable named bCognize. The program can be started with the following command:

> ./bCognize
