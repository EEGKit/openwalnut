This directory contains all kinds of static resources that need to be
somewhere in the build directory after building OpenWalnut.

The contents of this directory get copied directly to the build directory.
This means: everything in bin, will be copied to build/bin and so on. This
makes it very easy top provided resources. Just copy them in here and 
everything will be managed by CMake.


Contents:
---------

bin - contains several helper scripts to start walnut with gdb
share - contains fonts needed by the OSG
