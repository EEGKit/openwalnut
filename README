OpenWalnut
==========

OpenWalnut is an open source tool for multi-modal medical and brain data
visualization. Its universality allows it to be easily extended and used in a
large variety of application cases. It is both, a tool for the scientific user
and a powerful framework for the visualization researcher.  OpenWalnut is
licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. Written
entirely in Standard C++ and using a number of portable libraries (e.g.
OpenSceneGraph and  Qt), it runs on all Windows platforms, OSX, and
GNU/Linux operating systems.

INSTALLING

You have several options for installing OpenWalnut.
 * Build it -> see next section
 * Download a binary archive from our website and extract it
    * Inside the extracted directory, run bin/openwalnut
 * Download one of our binary packages for your distribution
 * Check the NeuroDebian repository
    * We are currently working on a OpenWalnut package which is intended to be
      released in NeuroDebian (http://neuro.debian.net/)

BUILDING
========

As you currently read this README, we presume that you already have the source.
If not, check http://www.openwalnut.org. There, you can download source archives
and get the URL to our mercurial repository.

Required Dependencies:
----------------------

* Qt4 (>= 4.3)
* OpenSceneGraph (>= 2.8.0)
* Boost (>= 1.39.0)

Compilation on Unix-like systems:
---------------------------------

If you have installed all required third party libs, you can compile OpenWalnut
by using the common routine:

cd build
cmake ../src
make
make install -- this is optional and installs everything.

After that, OpenWalnut can be used inside the build directory.

If you want to install only a part of OpenWalnut, you can issue

make list_install_tarets

The listed targets will then only install the specified part.

Compilation on Windows and Mac:
-------------------------------

This is a little bit more complicated. We give you a step-by-step explanation
on http://www.openwalnut.org.
