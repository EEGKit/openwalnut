# OW Version File. This file specifies the version. The line VERSION=X.Y.Z is
# used and parsed. If you do not want a version, comment it out.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you modify the file, cmake re-creates the version header. But
#            it is not able to set all library version. Please re-run cmake if
#            you change something here.
#
# NOTE: do not add a space after #. The current CMake script will fail.
#VERSION=1.3.0
