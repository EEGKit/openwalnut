# OW Version File. This file specifies the version. The line VERSION=X.Y.Z is
# used and parsed. This file has to be here everytime. The VERSION needs to be
# set properly or CMake will fail.
#
# SYNTAX: The version string always is X.Y.Z with an optional postfix of "+hg".
#         If this postfix is set, CMake will replace it with the Mercurial 
#         Revision. This is useful for packaging in most cases.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you modify the file, cmake re-creates the version header. But
#            it is not able to set all library version. Please re-run cmake if
#            you change something here.
#
# NOTE: do not add a space after #. The current CMake script will fail.
VERSION=1.2.0+hg
