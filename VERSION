# OW Version File. This file specifies the version. The line VERSION=X.Y.Z is
# used and parsed. This file has to be here every time. The VERSION needs to be
# set properly or CMake will fail.
#
# SYNTAX: The version string always is 1.2.3 with an optional postfix of "+hg1234".
#         This is useful if building is done by scripts. If you want to automatically
#         add the correct HG revision, use only +hgX without number.
#         You can optionally add underscore separated tags. The allowed characters in
#         these tags are letters and numbers and you must begin with a letter.
#         See examples below.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you modify the file, cmake re-creates the version header. But
#            it is not able to set all library version. Please re-run cmake if
#            you change something here.
#
# Examples:
#   VERSION=1.2.0
#   VERSION=1.2.0+hgX  -> replaces the X with the current revision number
#   VERSION=1.2.0+hg1234 -> here, revision number was set by the build scripts for example.
#   VERSION=1.2.0_RC1_PreRelease_SomeText+hgX -> You can add arbitrary tags to the version string. But be careful. Usually only one tag is useful.

# The current version string:
VERSION=1.3.0_RC1+hgX
