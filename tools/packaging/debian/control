Description: Multi-modal medical and brain data visualization tool.
 OpenWalnut is a tool for multi-modal medical and brain data
 visualization. Its universality allows it to be easily extended and used in a
 large variety of application cases. It is both, a tool for the scientific user
 and a powerful framework for the visualization researcher. Besides others, it is
 able to load NIfTI data, VTK line data and RIFF-format CNT/AVR-files. OpenWalnut
 provides many standard visualization tools like line integral convolution (LIC),
 isosurface-extraction, glyph-rendering or interactive fiber-data exploration. The
 powerful framework of OpenWalnut allows researchers and power-users to easily 
 extend the functionality to their specific needs.
 .
 This package contains the core API of OpenWalnut.
