Description: Multi-modal medical and brain data visualization tool.
 OpenWalnut is an open source tool for multi-modal medical and brain data
 visualization. Its universality allows it to be easily extended and used in a
 large variety of application cases. It is both, a tool for the scientific user
 and a powerful framework for the visualization researcher.  OpenWalnut is
 licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. Written
 entirely in Standard C++ and using a number of portable libraries (e.g.
 OpenSceneGraph and  Qt), it runs on all Windows platforms, OSX, and
 GNU/Linux operating systems.
