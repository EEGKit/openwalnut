OpenWalnut Packaging - README
*****************************

This directory contains several helpers and configurations for building
OpenWalnut source and binary pckages. These scripts/configs ease the release-
management and reduce the manual overhead.

owpack:
*******

General:
********

This is an Ã¼ber-script for managing creation of source packages and binary
packages. Each operation with this script checks out a fresh copy to ensure
an absolutely clean source directory. This is very important, especially for
the debian packages.

To use it follow these steps:

$ mkdir ReleaseOpenWalnut
$ cd ReleaseOpenWalnut
$ cp somewhere/owpack .

You then need to edit the script. The top lines are self-explaining. Fill in
certain information, like package maintainer and so on, as well as version 
and revision. Then you have several options:

$ owpack src_archive    <- creates an tar.gz and zip archive with the source
$ owpack cpack          <- builds OW and uses our CPack Setup to create binary
                           archives (like a binary tar.gz or a  self-extracting
                           archive)
$ owpack deb            <- uses our debian configuration to build an debian
                           source package and builds it
